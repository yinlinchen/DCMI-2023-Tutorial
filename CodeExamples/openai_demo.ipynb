It is a world of wonder, teeming with life and holding countless mysteries. Let me take you on a journey to explore the beauty and significance of the ocean.\n","\n","The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that stretches across the globe, connecting continents and shaping the climate. It plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's temperature by absorbing and distributing heat from the sun. This process influences weather patterns, making the ocean a vital component of our planet's delicate balance.\n","\n","Beneath the surface, the ocean is a thriving ecosystem, home to an incredible array of marine life. From the tiniest plankton to the largest whales, countless species have adapted to the ocean's diverse habitats. Coral reefs, with their vibrant colors and intricate structures, provide shelter and sustenance to a multitude of marine organisms. Deep-sea trenches, on the other hand, harbor mysterious creatures that have adapted to survive in extreme conditions of darkness and pressure.\n","\n","The ocean also holds immense economic importance. It serves as a highway for international trade, with ships transporting goods across continents. It is a source of food for millions of people, providing sustenance through fishing and aquaculture. Additionally, the ocean offers vast reserves of natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, which are essential for various industries.\n","\n","However, the ocean is facing numerous challenges. Pollution, overfishing, and climate change are threatening its delicate balance. Plastic waste, oil spills, and harmful chemicals are polluting its waters, endangering marine life and ecosystems. Rising temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching and disrupting the delicate food chains that sustain life in the ocean.\n","\n","Understanding the importance of the ocean and the threats it faces is crucial for our collective well-being. We must strive to protect and conserve this precious resource. Through sustainable practices, responsible fishing, and reducing our carbon footprint, we can help preserve the ocean's beauty and ensure its abundance for future generations.\n","\n","In conclusion, the ocean is a magnificent and vital part of our planet. It is a source of inspiration, a provider of resources, and a hub of biodiversity. By appreciating its wonders and taking action to protect it, we can ensure that the ocean continues to thrive and enrich our lives for years to come.\n"]}],"source":["# Few-Shot Prompting\n","messages=[\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"system\",\n","      \"content\": \"Answer in a consistent style.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about patience.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n","      \"content\": \"The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about the ocean.\"\n","    }\n","]\n","\n","response = get_completion(messages)\n","\n","if response.choices:\n","    print(response.choices[0].message[\"content\"])\n","else:\n","    print(\"No response received.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"gOt8E58mI39S"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["SELECT ?birthPlace WHERE { \n","  dbr:Albert_Einstein dbo:birthPlace ?birthPlace \n","}\n"]}],"source":["# Instruct and Zero-shot Prompting\n","messages = [\n","    {\n","        \"role\": \"system\",\n","        \"content\": \"Convert question into Sparql query for dbpedia.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"role\": \"user\",\n","        \"content\": \"Where was Albert Einstein born?\"\n","    }\n","]\n","\n","response = get_completion(messages, model_version=4)\n","\n","if response.choices:\n","    print(response.choices[0].message[\"content\"])\n","else:\n","    print(\"No response received.\")\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMOvlRRcpsqA/9hxUbNiGIy","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
